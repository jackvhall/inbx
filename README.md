# INBX cli notes tool

## Concept
This tool enables one to create ephemeral notes from the command line. These notes are saved in markdown format. 

Initially, each note will create a new markdown file in a configurable location. In the future, features may include:
- Timed reminders
- Timestamps
- Tags
- Append specific files, identified perhaps by tag

The ideas for this system came from my initial desire to stay within the command line (where I do everything) when needing to take a quick note.
I use the Zettelkasten notes system, so these notes are intended to be ephemeral and processed into more cohesive and coherent texts later on.
